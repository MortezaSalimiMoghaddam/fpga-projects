Here are the projects I've done on Vivado using VHDL

### project_1
is a BCD to binary converter that can handle transformation of numbers up to 99 which are fiven in BCD.

### project1_extended
provides you with the code of project one which has been edited so that in can get the job done using only one process 
statement which means that code is fully synchronous, given we have only one clock in this project. it's also been 
edited so that it takes only one input and seperates all the two consecutively presented numbers and operates on them

### project_Data_Width_Converter_1
takes in 20-bit inputs and gives 64-bit outputs. This project exercises some of the concepts of CDC and timing 
constraints that are of high importance when using vivado professionally.

#### the pdf files are the result of my researchs and I hope that they come in handy for you!
